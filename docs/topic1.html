                <p>
                    A <strong>cookie</strong> is a small piece of data stored on a user's device, designed to remember information across sessions and preferences. Cookies are essential for providing personalized web experiences.

                <p>
                    Cookies were first introduced in 1994, in collaboration with the <em>Netscape Navigator</em> web browser. Initially, they were used to track whether a person had visited a website before. Over time, their use has expanded, and they are now integral to many web applications, such as keeping users logged in or remembering their language preferences.
