                <h2>History of HTML</h2>
                <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was developed in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee and has grown drastically over time. It is now a central component of web development. HTML allows text to be non-linear, meaning it can be linked to other texts. It also incorporates hypermedia, such as graphics, videos, and sounds, in addition to text.</p>
                
                <p>HTML is the markup language for web documents. Content is placed within tags, and the browser interprets these tags to display content appropriately. When used with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), HTML helps design and arrange web pages according to the desired layout.</p>
                
                <p>HTML has evolved over the years, with major versions released, including HTML 1.0, HTML 2.0, HTML 3.2, HTML 4.01, XHTML, and the current version, HTML5. HTML5, which was released in 2014, introduced significant improvements, especially in terms of multimedia support and web applications.</p>
                
                <p>As the web continues to grow, HTML will evolve alongside new technologies, continuing to be an essential component in web development.</p>
